# Express Template

## App Goals

This is simply a template I use to get started with. If you wish to use this yourself, feel free to clone this repository. To get started, clone this repository to an empty directory on your development machine.

```
    git clone https://github.com/WidesVs2/express-template.git
```

After cloned to your machine, simply run `npm install` to install node modules, run `npm run dev` to start server on port 5000. Be sure to go into config/keys.js and enter your MongoDb username, password, and database name inside the MongoUri. Or, you can edit the code to utilize a different database service. Happy Coding!
